# Linear-Regression-Demo

The necessity of using a logarithmic scale demonstrates that most of the points are "squished" down near the x-axis. While this offers an approximate mean of the data, it is clear that the relationship between number of kids and income is not correlated and therefore not causal (duh). There is a link with the outliers because the upper confidence band mark a downward trend from 2-6 kids, and having 0 have the highest incomes total and sharply declining to 1. This would show that many of the most wealthy people don't have children, though not because having a child would cause lower earnings (literally yes but not dealbreaking for the richest).
